The following is my code
```{r}
factorial_formula <- function(a){
  i<-1
  fact<-1
  max <- a
  while (i <= a){
    fact<- i * fact
    i <- i+1
  }
  fact
}
combination_formula <- function(x,n){
  return(factorial_formula(x)/(factorial_formula(n) * factorial_formula(x-n)))
}
```
Here are some experiments.
5 choose 3 is 
```{r echo=FALSE}
combination_formula(5,3)
```
10 choose 5 is
```{r echo=FALSE}
combination_formula(10,5)
```
